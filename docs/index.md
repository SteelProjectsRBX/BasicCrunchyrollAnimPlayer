# BasicCrunchyrollAnimPlayer

This is essentially a small wrapper based off [ffrostfall's crunchyroll](https://github.com/ffrostfall/crunchyroll) animation solver<sup><span style = "font-size: 0.6em;"> (hilarious name btw)</sup> with barebones animation playing functionality.

My motive for creating this was to start learning how to use rojo & other professional tools, and because I needed to replace default roblox animations to be compatible with my game that has custom replication & lag compensation.
